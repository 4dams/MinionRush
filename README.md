# Minion Rush

[b]Minion Rush[/b] is an homage to an old browser game developed by Riot Games called 'The Teemoing'.
In this game, however, you're not sacrificing minions, but playing one racing a friend!

## Upcoming

Soon, there will be some mobs you have to play against. These will spawn periodically and the player has to dodge them
by becoming a ghost for a short amount of time. While being a ghost, the player is unable to move and may lose progress!
If hit by an enemy mob, the player's score will be set back by 10 / 20 / 50, depending on the difficulty chosen.

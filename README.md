# Minion Rush

**Minion Rush** is an homage to an old browser game developed by Riot Games called 'The Teemoing'.<br>
In this game, however, you're not sacrificing minions, but playing one, racing a friend!

## Controls
**Player 1:** `S` for moving, `D` for going into ghost mode<br>
**Player 2:** `L` for moving, `K` for going into ghost mode

## Upcoming

Soon, there will be some mobs you have to play against. These will spawn periodically and the player has to dodge them
by becoming a ghost for a short amount of time. While being a ghost, the player is unable to move and may lose progress!
If hit by an enemy mob, the player's score will be set back by 10 / 20 / 50, depending on the difficulty chosen.

## Deploying Your Own Version
In order to make changes and then play your own version of the game, just download the repository 
[(here)](https://github.com/4dams/MinionRush/archive/master.zip) and spin up a 
local (or hosted) webserver. For ease of use, I'd recommend [Serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve) by the guys over at 
[Zeit](https://github.com/zeit/serve)!<br>
**PixiJS will not run without a webserver!**
